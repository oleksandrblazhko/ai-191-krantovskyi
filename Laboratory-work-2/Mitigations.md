Refer: https://aka.ms/tmt-th10b and https://aka.ms/tmt-th10c                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 6          | Restrict access to Azure SQL Database instances by configuring server-level and database-level firewall rules to permit connections from selected networks (e.g. a virtual network or a custom set of IP addresses) where possible. Refer:https://aka.ms/tmt-th143                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 7          | Clients connecting to an Azure SQL Database instance using a connection string should ensure encrypt=true and trustservercertificate=false are set. This configuration ensures that connections are encrypted only if there is a verifiable server certificate (otherwise the connection attempt fails). This helps protect against Man-In-The-Middle attacks. Refer: https://aka.ms/tmt-th144                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 8          | Enable Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) on Azure SQL Database instances to have data encrypted at rest. Refer:https://aka.ms/tmt-th145a. Use the Always Encrypted feature to allow client applications to encrypt sensitive data before it is sent to the Azure SQL Database. Refer: https://aka.ms/tmt-th145b                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
